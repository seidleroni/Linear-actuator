# Linear Actuator Motion Calculator

**Visualize trapezoidal and triangular motion profiles in real-time.**

This application provides an interactive tool to calculate and visualize the motion profile of a linear actuator. You can adjust parameters such as distance, maximum velocity, acceleration, and deceleration to see how they affect the motion profile.

**[Live Application](https://seidleroni.github.io/Linear-actuator/)**

## Features

*   **Real-time Updates:** The motion profile chart updates instantly as you adjust the parameters.
*   **Trapezoidal and Triangular Profiles:** The calculator automatically determines whether the motion profile is trapezoidal (with a constant velocity phase) or triangular (no constant velocity phase).
*   **Detailed Results:** The total time for the motion is displayed, and the chart provides a visual representation of the velocity over time.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Sliders make it easy to experiment with different parameter values.
